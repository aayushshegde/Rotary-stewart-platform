The Slider Crank Mechanism, is an inspiration for the rotary stewart platform. As the Motion of the slider crank is actually in a linear manner, but if we remove the guiding path then we actually get the unconstrained motion
which would be all over the place. Now if we add a spherical joint for the links end and then fidure out the motion >>> It tends to be a leg link of the stewart platform.

We dont need to rotate a full circle for the stewart platform, a semi circular motion is repertitive on both halves of the cycle. Hence we can restrict our range to 180 degrees. From the image, we can conclude regarding the mechanism.

Joint 2, is where we can use a spherical joint to provide an additional degree of freedom (DOF).
